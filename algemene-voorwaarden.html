                  <h3>What is the history of Digital Nachos?</h3>
                  <p>When Aneta was looking for a job as a developer, she found out that many Dutch companies need skilled IT professionals, and there aren’t plenty in the Netherlands. With Annette’s experience in recruitment, the two noticed the opportunity of matching interesting Dutch IT vacancies with tech specialists from Poland, Aneta’s native country.</p>
                  <h3>Who are our clients?</h3>
                  <p>Our aim is to match you with a challenging job in one of the Netherlands’ top IT companies. We work with clients in the whole country, so it’s up to you whether you prefer living in a city, near the seaside or close to the woods. 
                  <h3>Why do we recruit in Central and Eastern Europe?</h3>
                  <p>
                  The demand for IT professionals in the Netherlands is much bigger than the actual number of candidates. Because of our connection to Central and Eastern Europe, we decided to recruit in this area. Many young IT specialists value the opportunity of working abroad for some time. It is not only a fantastic experience professionally and personally, you also benefit from the fact that Dutch wages are actually much higher than your current one.</p>
                  <h3>What can Digital Nachos do for you?</h3>
                <p>If you are interested in an IT job in the Netherlands, we would love to get in touch with you! In a personal Skype interview, we discuss your profile, skills and your wishes. Our job is then to find the perfect match with one of our clients. When both sides are positive, you can start planning your relocation to the Netherlands. Digital Nachos is always open and willing to assist you with your questions, before and after your arrival to the Netherlands!</p>
                  <h3>We found you a cool job in the Netherlands, what’s next?</h3>
                <p>When we have found your perfect match with our client, our job is done. You will have an employment contract directly with our client, not with Digital Nachos. Of course, you can always reach out to us whenever you need us. Also after your relocation to the Netherlands. It is our priority to make sure you are the happiest IT guy or gall in the universe!</p>
                  <h3>Can I also apply if I already live in the Netherlands?</h3>
                <p>Sure you can! If you are looking for your next IT job, you are at the right place.</p>
